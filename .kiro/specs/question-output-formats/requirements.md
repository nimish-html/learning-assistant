# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing question generator by providing users with three different output format options for generated questions. Currently, the system generates questions in a single format, but educators need different formats depending on their use case - whether for teaching with solved examples, creating assignments with answer keys, or preparing test papers with separate answer documents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to choose how answers are presented with my generated questions, so that I can use them for different educational purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the question generation form THEN the system SHALL display three output format options
2. WHEN a user selects "Solved Examples" format THEN the system SHALL generate questions with answers and explanations displayed immediately after each question
3. WHEN a user selects "Assignment Format" format THEN the system SHALL generate questions followed by an answer key section at the end
4. WHEN a user selects "Separate Documents" format THEN the system SHALL generate two separate documents - one with questions only and another with the complete answer key

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an educator creating practice materials, I want solved examples format, so that students can learn from worked solutions while practicing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Solved Examples" format is selected THEN each question SHALL be immediately followed by its answer and explanation
2. WHEN displaying solved examples THEN the answer SHALL be clearly marked and visually distinguished from the question
3. WHEN displaying solved examples THEN the explanation SHALL provide step-by-step reasoning for the correct answer

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an educator creating assignments, I want an answer key at the end, so that I can grade student work efficiently while keeping answers separate from questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Assignment Format" is selected THEN all questions SHALL be presented first without answers
2. WHEN "Assignment Format" is selected THEN a separate "Answer Key" section SHALL appear after all questions
3. WHEN displaying the answer key THEN each answer SHALL be clearly linked to its corresponding question number
4. WHEN displaying the answer key THEN explanations SHALL be included for reference

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an educator creating test papers, I want completely separate question and answer documents, so that I can distribute questions to students while keeping answers confidential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Separate Documents" format is selected THEN the system SHALL generate two distinct downloadable documents
2. WHEN generating separate documents THEN the question document SHALL contain only questions without any answers or hints
3. WHEN generating separate documents THEN the answer document SHALL contain question numbers, correct answers, and explanations
4. WHEN generating separate documents THEN both documents SHALL have consistent formatting and question numbering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the question generator, I want the output format selection to be intuitive and clearly explained, so that I can quickly choose the right format for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing format options THEN each option SHALL have a clear descriptive label explaining its use case
2. WHEN viewing format options THEN the interface SHALL provide visual examples or icons to illustrate each format type
3. WHEN a format is selected THEN the system SHALL remember the user's preference for the current session
4. WHEN generating questions THEN the selected format SHALL be clearly indicated in the output

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an educator, I want the different output formats to maintain consistent question quality and structure, so that the content remains reliable regardless of presentation format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any output format is selected THEN the underlying question generation logic SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN switching between formats THEN the same questions SHALL maintain identical content, answers, and explanations
3. WHEN generating questions in any format THEN all validation rules SHALL continue to apply
4. WHEN using any format THEN the question difficulty, subject, and exam alignment SHALL remain consistent

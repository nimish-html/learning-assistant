# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds persistent storage capabilities to the application using Supabase as the backend database, along with email-based authentication to enable users to save and retrieve their past question generation results. The system will allow users to create accounts, authenticate via email, and store their generated questions and answers for future reference.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account using my email address, so that I can save my generated questions and access them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display authentication options
2. WHEN a user provides a valid email address and password THEN the system SHALL create a new account
3. WHEN a user provides an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors
4. WHEN a user provides a password shorter than 8 characters THEN the system SHALL reject the registration
5. WHEN account creation is successful THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email to the user
6. WHEN a user clicks the confirmation link THEN the system SHALL activate their account

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to sign in with my email and password, so that I can access my saved content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and grant access
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their session across page refreshes
4. WHEN a user clicks sign out THEN the system SHALL end their session and redirect to the login page
5. WHEN a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide a password reset option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to save my generated questions and answers, so that I can reference them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates questions THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save the results
2. WHEN a user chooses to save results THEN the system SHALL store the questions, answers, and metadata in the database
3. WHEN saving results THEN the system SHALL associate them with the authenticated user's account
4. WHEN a user provides a title for their saved results THEN the system SHALL store it with the content
5. WHEN saving fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view my previously saved results, so that I can review past work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses their saved results THEN the system SHALL display a list of their saved items
2. WHEN displaying saved results THEN the system SHALL show the title, creation date, and preview of content
3. WHEN a user clicks on a saved result THEN the system SHALL display the full content
4. WHEN a user has no saved results THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
5. WHEN loading saved results fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to delete my saved results, so that I can manage my stored content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing saved results THEN the system SHALL provide delete options for each item
2. WHEN a user clicks delete THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation
3. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the item from the database
4. WHEN deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL update the list view
5. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly whether I'm authenticated or not, so that I can still use basic features without an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user generates questions THEN the system SHALL function normally but not offer save options
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access saved results THEN the system SHALL prompt them to sign in
3. WHEN a user signs in after generating content THEN the system SHALL offer to save their current work
4. WHEN the authentication service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL still allow basic question generation
5. WHEN switching between authenticated and unauthenticated states THEN the system SHALL maintain a consistent user experience
